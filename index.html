            Welcome to the Utumishi Boys High School located in Nakuru
            town. The school provides excellent teaching practices by extra
            learned teachers from some of the best universities in the country.
            Students are raised to become as expected by their communities 
            and families.
            We offer both learning trips in respect to the subject of 
            concern or clubs and joyous trips where students are taken to 
            see facinating places like The Menengai crater and Lake Bogoria 
            hot springs. Health services are on check, as students might 
            get infected with various common diseases which in most cases are
            communicable, therefore an office is set aside with a nurse for 
            proper medical checkup.
