    <h1>Utumishi Boys High School</h1>
    <h2>[Motto]Strive for excellence and honour</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Utumishi Boys High School located in Nakuru
        town. The school provides excellent teaching practices by extra
        learned teachers from some of the best universities in the country.
        Students are raised to become as expected by their communities 
        and families.
        We offer both learning trips in respect to the subject of 
        concern or clubs and joyous trips where students are taken to 
        see facinating places like The Menengai crater and Lake Bogoria 
        hot springs. Health services are on check, as students might 
        get infected with various common diseases which in most cases are
        communicable, therefore an office is set aside with a nurse for 
        proper medical checkup.
         </p>
